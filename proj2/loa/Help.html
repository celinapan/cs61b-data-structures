<h1><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Lines of Action</span></h1>

<p>Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie. It is played on an 8&times;8 board by two sides, Black and White. Each side has twelve pieces. The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece. Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>

<p>1. The black pieces are placed on the top and bottom row of the board, while the white pieces are placed on the left and right column of the board.</p>
<p>2. The players alternate moves, starting with Black.</p>
<p>3. A player to move must move one of its pieces. A move takes place in a straight line, exactly as many squares as there are pieces of either color anywhere along the line of action.</p>
<p>4. A player cannot jump over its own pieces.</p>
<p>5. A player cannot jump over the opponent&rsquo;s pieces, but can capture them by landing on them.</p>
<p>6. The goal of a player is to turn all own pieces on the board into one contiguous region. The first player to do that wins.</p>
<p>7. If one player&rsquo;s pieces are reduced by captures to a single piece, the game is a win for this player.</p>
<p>8. If the move limit is reached and neither side are contiguous, the game is a tie.</p>
